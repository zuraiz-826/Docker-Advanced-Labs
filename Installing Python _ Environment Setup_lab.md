Task 2: Verify Installation
Step 2.1: Check the Python Version
Open the command line interface (CLI) or terminal.
Run the following command to check the installed Python version:
python --version
or on some systems:
python3 --version
Ensure the output displays the correct version and does not result in an error.
Task 3: Install an IDE or Text Editor
Choice of IDE or text editor greatly impacts productivity. Popular options include:

Choose the Community version for open-source usage.
Download and install PyCharm by following the platform-specific instructions.
Additional Step: Configuring the Text Editor
Example Configuration in VS Code:
Install the Python extension from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Verify Python path settings in VS Code to match the installed Python version.
Conclusion
By the end of this lab, you should have:

Successfully installed Python 3 on your system.
Verified your installation through the CLI.
Set up a development environment using either VS Code or PyCharm.
With these setups, you are now equipped to embark on Python programming efficiently in a well-configured environment.
