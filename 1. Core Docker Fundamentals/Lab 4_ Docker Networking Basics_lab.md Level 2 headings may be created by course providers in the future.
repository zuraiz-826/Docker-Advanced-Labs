Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, you should have:

Familiarity with command-line interface (CLI)
Completed previous Docker labs or equivalent knowledge
Understanding of basic networking concepts (IP addresses, ports)
Lab Environment Setup
Al Nafi Cloud Machines: This lab uses Al Nafi's pre-configured Linux-based cloud machines. Simply click Start Lab to access your environment - no need to build your own VM or install Docker manually.

Your cloud machine comes with:

Docker Engine pre-installed and configured
All necessary networking tools
Root/sudo access for Docker commands
Task 1: Understanding Docker's Default Bridge Network
Subtask 1.1: Explore the Default Bridge Network
Docker automatically creates a default bridge network when installed. Let's examine this network.

Step 1: List all Docker networks

docker network ls
You should see output similar to:

NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
abcd1234efgh   bridge    bridge    local
ijkl5678mnop   host      host      local
qrst9012uvwx   none      null      local
Step 2: Inspect the default bridge network

docker network inspect bridge
This command shows detailed information about the bridge network, including:

Subnet: The IP range assigned to containers
Gateway: The gateway IP address
Connected containers: Currently running containers on this network
Subtask 1.2: Run a Container on the Default Network
Step 1: Run a simple container on the default bridge network

docker run -d --name web-server-1 nginx:alpine
Step 2: Verify the container is running

docker ps
Step 3: Inspect the bridge network again to see the connected container

docker network inspect bridge
Look for the Containers section to see your web-server-1 container listed with its assigned IP address.

Task 2: Running Multiple Containers on the Same Network
Subtask 2.1: Create Multiple Containers on Default Network
Step 1: Run a second nginx container

docker run -d --name web-server-2 nginx:alpine
Step 2: Run a third container with a different image (Alpine Linux)

docker run -d --name alpine-client alpine:latest sleep 3600
Step 3: Verify all containers are running

docker ps
Step 4: Check the bridge network to see all connected containers

docker network inspect bridge
Subtask 2.2: Test Container Communication
Step 1: Get the IP address of web-server-1

docker inspect web-server-1 | grep IPAddress
Step 2: Test connectivity from alpine-client to web-server-1

docker exec alpine-client ping -c 3 <IP_ADDRESS_OF_WEB_SERVER_1>
Replace <IP_ADDRESS_OF_WEB_SERVER_1> with the actual IP address from Step 1.

Step 3: Test HTTP connectivity

docker exec alpine-client wget -qO- http://<IP_ADDRESS_OF_WEB_SERVER_1>
You should see the default nginx welcome page HTML content.

Task 3: Creating and Managing Custom Networks
Subtask 3.1: Create a Custom Bridge Network
Step 1: Create a custom network named app-network

docker network create app-network
Step 2: List networks to confirm creation

docker network ls
You should now see your app-network in the list.

Step 3: Inspect the custom network

docker network inspect app-network
Subtask 3.2: Create Additional Network Types
Step 1: Create a custom network with specific subnet

docker network create --driver bridge --subnet=192.168.100.0/24 custom-subnet-network
Step 2: Verify the network creation

docker network inspect custom-subnet-network
Notice the custom subnet configuration in the IPAM section.

Task 4: Using --network Flag to Specify Networks
Subtask 4.1: Run Containers on Custom Network
Step 1: Run a container on the custom app-network

docker run -d --name app-server-1 --network app-network nginx:alpine
Step 2: Run a second container on the same custom network

docker run -d --name app-server-2 --network app-network nginx:alpine
Step 3: Run a client container on the custom network

docker run -d --name app-client --network app-network alpine:latest sleep 3600
Subtask 4.2: Test Custom Network Communication
Step 1: Test connectivity using container names (DNS resolution)

docker exec app-client ping -c 3 app-server-1
Step 2: Test HTTP connectivity using container names

docker exec app-client wget -qO- http://app-server-1
Important Note: On custom networks, containers can communicate using container names as hostnames, which is not available on the default bridge network.

Subtask 4.3: Compare Network Isolation
Step 1: Try to ping a container on the default network from custom network

docker exec app-client ping -c 3 web-server-1
This should fail, demonstrating network isolation between different Docker networks.

Task 5: Advanced Container Communication and Network Management
Subtask 5.1: Connect Containers to Multiple Networks
Step 1: Connect an existing container to an additional network

docker network connect app-network alpine-client
Step 2: Verify the connection

docker network inspect app-network
Step 3: Test connectivity from the multi-network container

docker exec alpine-client ping -c 3 app-server-1
Subtask 5.2: Port Mapping and External Access
Step 1: Run a container with port mapping

docker run -d --name web-public --network app-network -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine
Step 2: Test external access (from host)

curl http://localhost:8080
Step 3: Test internal network access

docker exec app-client wget -qO- http://web-public
Subtask 5.3: Network Cleanup and Management
Step 1: Disconnect a container from a network

docker network disconnect app-network alpine-client
Step 2: Remove containers

docker stop web-server-1 web-server-2 alpine-client app-server-1 app-server-2 app-client web-public
docker rm web-server-1 web-server-2 alpine-client app-server-1 app-server-2 app-client web-public
Step 3: Remove custom networks

docker network rm app-network custom-subnet-network
Step 4: Verify cleanup

docker network ls
docker ps -a
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Container Cannot Communicate
Symptoms: Ping or HTTP requests fail between containers Solutions:

Verify containers are on the same network: docker network inspect <network_name>
Check container names and IP addresses
Ensure containers are running: docker ps
Issue 2: Network Already Exists Error
Symptoms: Error when creating network with existing name Solutions:

List existing networks: docker network ls
Use a different network name
Remove existing network if not needed: docker network rm <network_name>
Issue 3: Cannot Remove Network
Symptoms: Error when trying to remove network Solutions:

Check for connected containers: docker network inspect <network_name>
Stop and remove connected containers first
Disconnect containers: docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>

Best Practices for Docker Networking
Use Custom Networks: Always create custom networks for multi-container applications instead of relying on the default bridge
Meaningful Names: Use descriptive names for networks and containers
Network Segmentation: Separate different application tiers using different networks
DNS Resolution: Leverage container name-based DNS resolution on custom networks
Port Mapping: Only expose ports that need external access
Cleanup: Regularly remove unused networks and containers
Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully learned the fundamentals of Docker networking. You explored Docker's default bridge network, created custom networks, and demonstrated container communication both within and across networks.

Key accomplishments:

Understood how Docker's default bridge network operates
Created and managed custom Docker networks
Connected multiple containers to the same network
Used container names for DNS resolution on custom networks
Implemented network isolation and security
Managed port mapping for external access
Why this matters: Docker networking is crucial for building scalable, secure containerized applications. Understanding these concepts enables you to design proper network architectures for microservices, implement security through network segmentation, and troubleshoot connectivity issues in containerized environments.

These skills are essential for the Docker Certified Associate (DCA) certification and real-world container orchestration scenarios. In production environments, proper networking configuration ensures your applications can communicate securely and efficiently while maintaining isolation between different services and environments.
